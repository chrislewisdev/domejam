# Clean That Castle!

This game is my entry for the [DOME](https://domeengine.com/) game jam held in March 2020.

For more details or to play the game itself, [check out the itch.io page](https://magspinner.itch.io/clean-that-castle).

The source code here has been commented to hopefully help serve as a good example of how to use DOME. Try checking out the `main.wren` file first, and then explore the `src/` folder for the actual core game code. And of course, check out the [DOME documentation](https://domeengine.com/modules/) as well.

I've included in the repo both the Windows DOME executable and a `tasks.json` for Visual Studio Code users - this lets you start up the game by running the default task (default keybinding is `Ctrl+Shift+B`). On other platforms you probably need to [download the appropriate DOME release for it](https://github.com/avivbeeri/dome/releases/tag/1.1.1).
